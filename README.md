# Linear Regression Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of linear regression using Python and NumPy.

## Overview
Linear regression is a basic machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous variable based on one or more input features. In this implementation, we use the ordinary least squares method to find the best-fitting line to the given data points.

## Customization
You can customize the behavior of the algorithm by modifying the parameters and data in the main.py file. Additionally, you can explore different datasets and experiment with various features to improve the model's performance.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
